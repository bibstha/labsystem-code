This file contains the history of labsystem.m-o-p.de.



Feature Requests:
-------------------
 - Edit page for new semesters config
 
 - Test new config files
 - Fields in setup adden!
 
 - Add Markdown help as module or as standard...
 
 - Captcha/ Check on registraton page
 
 - Search on manage pages: SELECT * FROM `TABLE` WHERE `FIELD` like '%SEARCHSTRING%'
   - Maybe in page sorter?

2011-11-20
-------------------
  /pages/register.php
    The config parameter "registerIPprefix" can be a comma separated list now.
  /include/classes/elements/LlElement.inc
    Corrected a bug: the lab closing algorithm used the user's current 
    team which might have changed from when the user did the lab. Now it
    takes the team from the labUID status ($permissions['currentTeam']).
    
2011-11-20
-------------------
  /include/classes/Url.inc
    Changed rawLink2 to be faster and to put the variables by the system BEFORE
    those passed in an URL. This results in overriding by variables given in the link...
  /pages/register.php
    Added a check for a given IP prefix to the register page.
    This effectively allows only students in a certain network prefix (like University)
    to register.
    Only if the fields are present in the config the check is done:
      registerIPprefix   = "131.159." ; Only from this IP prefix (String comparison, so IPv6 should work as well) registration is enabled.
      registerIPprefixViolationNote = "You can only register from within the university network. Either connect from the university or use the VPN."
      
2011-11-15
-------------------
  /include/classes/elements/LlElement.inc
  /include/menu.inc
    Changed l?.ALLlabStatusCompact to be linked to l1 and to have the correct title.
    Thus it will work always now (as l1 is always there).

2011-11-14
-------------------
  /include/classes/Menu.inc
    Handle https as external link as well...
  /include/menu.inc
    Added comment to full url register page.
    The advantage is that all registrations go to one singl page then.
    This page can also provide the intro labs already for the automatically created accounts.
  /include/classes/Menu.inc
    Does not handle the login.php page as an external page now.
  /include/customErrHandle.inc
    Escaped HTML to fix reflected XSS flaw
    Thanks to Johannes Naab for reporting!!
 
2011-11-13
-------------------
  /include/hostname2config.inc
  ->  /include/configuration.inc + ../ini/host2config.ini
    Moved functionality to the configuration.inc
      Checks now if ../ini/host2config.ini is present.
      If so and it contains the current first prefix XYZ. the 
      prefix from ../ini/host2config.ini is used to load the config.
  /include/logger.inc      
    Gets initiated by a config variable now. If logDir = "someDir" is 
    set the logs will be created in this directory. If it is not set or 
    empty no logs are getting created.

    If cooke is available use the cookie for transport when possible.
  /pages/accessableLabs.php
    If a schedule exists but the lab does not this entry is ignored on this page.
  /include/classes/LsElement.inc
    If a schedule exists for a non-available element the schedule gets automatically deleted.
  /include/classes/Url.inc
  /pages/uaManageUsers.php
  /php/uaManageUsersExecute.php
    Fixed redirect link.

2011-11-09
-------------------
  /include/classes/elements/LlElement.inc
    Added delete button for labs to be exported. Deletes only the l-Element 
    keeping all building blocks. This removes the lab from the list. Helpful 
    when a lab is imported multiple times but not needed any more (updated 
    version in same instance etc.). Full deletion is not necessary as simply 
    a new instance can be spawned.
  /pages/XIport.php
  /syspix/labsystem_wait_17x117.gif
    Added progress bar image on exporting.

    Added htmlentities to style sheet info in <PRE> at import and export.
    
    Fixed Stylesheet export issue when more than one lab was exported at a time. $stylesToExport & $usedClasses get reinitialized now with each lab.
    
  /include/XIlib.inc
    Included the function validFilename to make compatible filenames from exported files.
    Added urldecode here as proper filenames in html are with %20 instead of space etc.
    
    Included function to delete export directory before export if it exists.
    
    Updated the regex for handling files and pictures.
    Added code to decode urlencoded urls and to remove trailing and heading spaces.
    
    Changed file structure for export:
     /css
     /images
     /files
     /data
    
2011-10-21

  /pages/uaManageUsers.php
    GroupBy -> orderBy for sorting as group by only lists one entry...
  /pages/register.php
    registerFor field added ('.$_GET['config'].') as when registering on the _ua otherwhise there is no separation between servers possible.
    registerFor contains now CourseID.Server Subdomain.
  /include/init.inc
    Changed comments for config2host as it does not change $_GET['config'] but fill the $configPrefix (has to be like this for links...)
  /include/menu.inc
    Registration link points to /?address=register
  /index.php
    Added routing for address=accessableLabs and address=register

    Fixed setup demopage content login link.
  /ini/*.ini
    Changed the ini files to use the include statement.
  /pages/register.php
    Added form to register for the current course.
    
    Nice feature: All fields you add to your userDB will automatically be queried!
                  You can even add customized explanations in your language file by just naming the String like the DB field.
    
  /ini/{en,de}.lng
    titleRegister, MnuEntryRegister,

  /include/classes/elements/LlDBInterface.inc
  /include/classes/elements/LsDBInterface.inc
    Changed the setData function history. "]" as string[0] indicates the import now and 
    prevents adding the current user line so that the history is the original one.

2011-10-08
-------------------
  /include/XIlib.inc
  /pages/XIport.php

      - loads the $cfg->get('UserStyleSheet')
      - parses it extracting the tags
      - only takes into regard the last tags to prevent from building a dom tree
      - when importing only imports non existing styles
    Fixed stylesheet issues for the previes.html.
    Included picture links to labsystem.m-o-p.de into preview.html so that it should be fully usable now.
    Added user output when exporting and importing styles so that the user knows what is done.

      - MnuTitleEdit        = "edit"
      - MnuEntryElements    = "elements"
      - MnuEntryStyleSheet  = "edit css"
      - MnuEntryXIport      = "import | export"

2011-10-07
-------------------
  /include/XIlib.inc
    Added support for MarkDown links and pictures when exporting/ importing.
    An alternative would be to convert Markdown to HTML when exporting. Did not chose this path for readability.
  /css/sys/labsys_mop_basic.css
    CAdded "inline" for _m_question p as MarkDown uses this style...
  
    
2011-09-13
-------------------
  /include/classes/LpElement.inc
    Added anchor as link when clicking on the view icon at the edit page.
  /include/classes/ElementButtons.inc

-------------------
  /setup/sql_new_ddb_input_tbl.sql
    Added new row `hasFileUpload` tinyint(1) DEFAULT '0'

2011-07-26
-------------------
  /include/classes/elements/L?DBInterface.inc
    setData()
      the adding was done using the DB. While this is in general good it removes also all history when importing. Thus it got changed back to using the provided history instead of that from the DB.
  /pages/XIport.php
    Import creates now automatically a schedule for yesterday for each imported element. -> Easy to edit. Gone so no security problem.
    Link to element from import page (top).
  /include/XIlib.inc
    Edited error in processElement.
    mapIt: preserve 1 as it is prototype and used for "non-existing" in Labs...
  /include/helper.inc:
    createNew:
      aded 's' element.
  
2011-06-23

  /pages/XIport.php
  /include/classes/elements/Element.inc
    Implemented javaScript warning onbeforeunload when things were changed on the page but not saved.
      In script.js a variable isDirty is initialized with false. It indicates the page is clean.
      In all inputs, textboxes and selectors onchange='isDirty=true' happens.
      In all saves onclick='isDirty=false' happens.
      The body is checking in its onbeforeunload if the page is dirty and if so showing the warning.
  
2011-06-16
-------------------
  /plugins/CSSTidy
    Added use of CSSTidy in saveFile for the CSS. It fixes the CSS and optimizes it.

    Removed link2 as it was identical to link2Element.
    link2Element, link2Url changed to use hidden divs.

  /include/menu.inc
    Introduced [accessable_labs] in menu. It automatically lists all available (visible before schedule) and then all scheduled labs in the order of their schedule.
    More labs have to be set visible_before_schedule or to be scheduled. They are accessable over the "manage elements" page.
    Moved my rights, my status and send mail to menu.inc out of the individual menu files.

  /css/sys/labsys_mop_basic.css
    Added   .labsys_mop_content.labIndexNumber, .labsys_mop_content.labIndexText used by
  /pages/accessableLabs.php
    Lists all labs that are either visablebefore1stschedule or scheduled (same as with the [accessable_labs] in menu).
    
  /include/classes/elements/LsElement.inc:show
    Added showScheduleNote to be displayed on the AllSchedules page when shown.
    
  /include/classes/ElementMenues.inc

  /include/classes/elements/LlDBInterface.inc
    History deleted all previous history (bug from some revisions ago)

  /include/XIlib.inc
    Changed mapIt not to return identity but missing when there is no mapping. There is no mapping for deleted elements for instance.
    Changed reindexCollectionElements to use only non-missing elements (before it added ?1 then which led to confusions when a lab was exported that contained already deleted elements in collections).

2011-06-13
-------------------
  /css/sys/labsys_mop_basic.css
    Changed style labsys_mop_m_answers_table_checkbox_cell (added width: 100%) as text boxes for MCs were not full width in Chrome.

  As retIfTrue always evaluated consequence and alternative this could noticeable speed the system up.
  
2011-06-12
-------------------
  /include/classes/Pge.inc:
    Added sanitizeKeys( $string ) to sanitize constants in helper.inc: parseHTML before applying MarkUp.
  /include/helper.inc:
    Uses $pge->sanitizeKeys now before applying markup... (=> constants work with markup now)
    
  /include/classes/DBConnection.inc:
    Changed escapeString. Removed stripslashes ( $val ) as magic quotes is off by default in PHP now.
    
  /include/helper.inc
    Added support for auto formatting/ repairing/ indenting of HTML code using php's tidy.
    
  Added config parameter to control tidy:
    tidyHTML                = "TRUE"
    
  Affects setData functions in
    /include/classes/elements/L{p, s, m, l, i}DBInterface.inc
    
  Updated new* (invoked by newElement in each DBI) so that it uses setData.
  Updated setData in DBIs with a second parameter $createNew
  Update L*DBInterface + helper.inc to use setData instead of newElement respective the newLab etc. functions that got removed.
