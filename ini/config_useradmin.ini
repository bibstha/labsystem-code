; since you will have new user and new answers and so on.
; The data database might stay the same if you don't plan to make major changes to its content.
; If you plan so, you should also change it (p.e. by copying it), because the data are also the
; data for former memers (if they can still log in) and so they might get confused by the changed
; data base...

;; DATA DATABASE
; In this database all the web pages, all the lab questions and all the lab exercises are stored.

; change the contents.
