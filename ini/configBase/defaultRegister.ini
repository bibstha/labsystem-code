      <h3>What is the intended audience?</h3>
      <p>
        The intended audience of this course is <b>master</b> students with deeper interest and background in computer networks.<br>
        Basic knowledge in networking is required on a theoretical (e.g. lecture "Grundlagen: Rechnernetze und Verteilte Systeme") and a practical level (e.g. <a href="http://ilab.net.in.tum.de/">ilab</a> or own practical experience).
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>You should be familiar with the <b>Linux</b> Operating system at Shell level.</li>
        <li>You should beable to <b>write programs</b> in at least one programming language (e.g. Java, C, python).</li>
        <li>You should either have attended our <a href="http://ilab.net.in.tum.de/">bachelor practical exercise ilab</a> or be familiar with the <a href="http://ilab.net.in.tum.de?address=accessableLabs">topics it covers</a>.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        If you already know how the Internet works and you want to learn about selected networking concepts more in depth ilab<sup>2</sup> is the right course for you.<br>
        If you are not familiar with configuring services like DNS, VPN, Firewalls etc. <a href="http://ilab.net.in.tum.de?address=register">iLab1</a> is the right course for you.
      </p>

      
      <h3>What do I learn?</h3>
      <p>
        When finishing the course, you will have a <b>deep inside</b> into the covered topics.
        You can find a list of the topics <a href="http://ilab2.net.in.tum.de?address=accessableLabs">here</a>.
      </p>
      <p>
        You will get a good overview in the topics handled at our chair and therefore be <b>well prepared to do a thesis or a student assistant</b> work at our chair later.
      </p>
      <p>
        As the <b>entire course</b> is held in <b>English</b> you can train and improve your language skills.
      </p>
      
      <h3>How is the workflow?</h3>
      <p>
        The course consists of ten exercises.<br>
        For an exercise you will normally have one week; for longer exercises two weeks will be scheduled.
      </p>
      <p>
        The practical exercises are performed in <b>teams of two students</b>.<br>
        You should try to find a team partner that is on a similar level concerning the knowledge about the network backgrounds, as well as the Linux operating system.
      </p>
      <p>
        An exercise consists of three parts:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          A short weekly meeting where you get presented some theoretical background for the upcoming exercise.
        </li>
        <li>
          A so-called "prelab" where you make yourself familiar with the theoretical backgrounds of the current exercise.<br>
          This is done by each team member separately on ones own.<br>
          The prelab is done before the practical performance of the exercise.
        </li>
        <li>
          The practical exercise which is called "lab".<br>
          As stated above this part is done in your two-people team.<br>
          You will have your lab environment for one whole day of the week on which you can decide freely when to be in the lab and perform your practical exercise together.<br>
          This gives you the freedom to attend lectures in between, etc.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The course is entirely held in <b>English</b>.<br>
        You are expected to answer the questions in English as well.<br>
        This is a good example to exercise and improve your language skills!
      </p>
      <p>
        In contrast to many other practical exercises the course is entirely based on a <b><a href="http://labsystem.sourceforge.net/">web system</a></b>.<br>
        You will have access to the respective website from every PC that is connected to the Internet.<br>
        This allows you to freely choose your timeslots to perform the prelab or do final adjustments to the answers.
      </p>

      
      <h3>To which modules does this course belong?</h3>
      <p style="margin-bottom: 1em">
        <ul>
          <li>IN8903: Praktikum im Bereich Technische Informatik (10 ECTS)</li>
          <li>IN2106: Master-Praktikum (10 ECTS)</li>
        </ul>
      </p>
      
      <h3>When does the course start?</h3>
      <p>
        The kickoff will usually be in the first week of the semester.
        Please have a look at our <a href="http://www.net.in.tum.de/">chairs page</a> for further information.
      </p>
      <p>
        In the kickoff the teams will be formed and the timeslots will be allocated thus you have to physically attend this meeting.
      </p>

      <h3>How can I apply?</h3>
      <p>
        You find the registration form below
      </p>

      <p>
        As the practical exercises are performed in teams of two students, it is a good idea to already search a team partner right now.<br>
        You can give the name of your designated team partner in the application form.
      </p>      

      <p>
        As the places are usually in great demand you should register early.
      </p>
      
      <h3>Current State of Applications</h3>
      <p>
        The amount of free places is shown below the form.<br>
        Please <b>continue registering even if no places are left as usually not all students really participate at the end</b>.<br>
        The final decision about this will be at the kickoff.
      </p>

  afterRegisterMailText = "Welcome to the iLab2!

You have successfully registered to the course. 

If you already had an account in the labsystem it is still valid.
If you are a new participant you will receive your logon data from
the system already today.

One speciality of the ilab is that it is entirely supported by a
special web system. If you want you can directly start making
yourself familiar with the system. To do so simply logon to this
page:
       http://ilab2.net.in.tum.de?config=useradmin

You can also change your user name and your password on this
page. So it is a good idea to log on ;)

The system also provides you already with an insight to the
laboratory room's infrastructure and basics for the program-
ming languages used.

You find everything in the menu after logging in.

The next mandatory event for the practical exercise is the
kickoff meeting in the *first week of the semester*.

There the teams of two people each will be built and the
timeslots in the laboratory room will be assigned to the
teams.
If you are not sure with whom you want to do the lab
maybe it is a good chance to ask some of your friends if
they also want to participate. Of course you can also find
a team partner at the kickoff.

We wish you already a lot of fun with the exercises!
